<h4>Introduction</h4>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Over the years I have produced, managed and supported many creative venues and events that required design and coordination.  Creative design included graphics, marketing materials, displays, and presentations. As design continued to be important, the tools used to produce designs of all kinds changed to be more technologically innovative and faster.  Web sites and web applications were an extension of print and new computer programs and smart programmers helped proliferate sites of all kinds. Then, Web 2.0 made an appearance, which seemed to be the same "things", but in smaller packages.  The next wave is still upon us; social media.  

I have followed the trends.  It's so interesting to watch how people are drawn to the computer for so many reasons.  I've worked with different types of people and teams througout the changes in the industry and have been successful.  Moving forward with the teams, using creative innovative approaches to new projects, such as creating a new business, or two has been exciting.

<p> Or, if you're ready to grab some shoes and hit the gym, or go on a trip, remember not to use those old plastic, bags for your shoes.  Use an sml shoebag!  www.smlshoebags.com has cool new shoe bags.  They are great for gifts for your golf or bowling friends who just seem to have everything.</p>

<p>You will see from my experience that I have expanded my knowledge from creative graphics, displays, and presentations to online technologies for web sites, web applications, online meeting technologies, including the world of translations, and now more recently in social media and entrepreneurships.</p>
