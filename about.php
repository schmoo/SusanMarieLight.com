<h4>Work Summary</h4>

<p>Over the years I have produced, managed and supported many creative venues and marketing materials. I have worked with different types of teams in General Motors and with many suppliers outside of General Motors. I have hired and evaluated suppliers, contract employees and GM employees. Change management has been a major part of my assignments.  And, in all cases I find that it’s the people you work with, the people that you support and those who support your efforts that make the difference. People are the priority because the people create the culture, which is formed through shared values and beliefs.</p>

<h4>Passion</h4>

<p>As a people focused leader, I believe in servant leadership and knowledge sharing. Learning new technologies and processes, as well as learning and sharing new knowledge with team members is one of my passions. Over the years I have built and managed many types of teams, using creative, forward thinking individuals that created and suppported customers and colleagues. I enjoy learning about people’s skill sets and I try to match their skill sets with the right project for a win-win for the company.</p>

<p>You will see from my experience that I have expanded my knowledge from creative graphics, displays, and presentations to online technologies for web sites, web applications and online meeting technologies, including the world of translations.</p>
